Odontogenic myxoma wPerineural infiltration was also found. Immunohistochemical positivity for AE1/AE3, CK14, and smooth muscle actin was observed, and a low proliferative index measured by Ki67 expression was seen. The patient was then referred for oncologic treatment and is under follow-up in our department. Support: FAPEMIG PRIMARY DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYM- PHOMA OF THE MANDIBLE: A RARE CASE REPORT. GABRIELA ALVES RIBEIRO, VA^NIA DO CARMO RODRIGUES, ANDR EA BRAGA MOLERI, LUISA AGUIRRE BUEXM, LUCIANA WERNERSBACH PINTO, ADRIANA TEREZINHA NEVES NOVELLINO ALVES and, SIMONE DE QUEIROZ CHAVES LOURENCÂ¸O Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm of the lymphoid system and represents the majority cases of non- Hodgkin lymphomas. Nevertheless, it is a low-rate event in the head and neck region, especially as a primary occurrence. This is a case report of a primary extranodal diffuse large B-cell lym- phoma in the mandible of a 52-year-old male patient who had no previous neoplasm history. Clinical examination and imagerevealed a salivary gland neoplasm involving the sub gland presenting a cribriform architectural growth p the presence of basaloid and hyperchromatic neopclear halos, mitotic figures, and mitosoid cells. The underlying connective tissue presented scarce inflammatory cells. The data confirmed the original clinical hypothesis of multifocal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck disease). No treatment was performed because of the self-limited characteristics of the disease. The patient is now under 6-month follow-up, already showing early signs of lesion remission. ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA: A CASE REPORT. B  ARBARA MARTINS ANDRADE, SARA FERREIRA DOS SANTOS COSTA, ANDR E MYLLER BARBOSA SILVA, FELIPE PAIVA FONSECA, FL  AVIA SIROTHEAU CORRE^A PONTES, LUCAS LACERDA DE SOUZA and, H ELDER ANTO^NIO REBELO PONTES Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in most of the studies. It can affect any sali- vary gland, but it more commonly involves the minor salivary glands of the palate and the parotid glands, presenting as an asymptomatic slow-growing swelling in middle-aged adults. The aim of this report is to present a case of adenoid cystic carcinoma affecting a 45-year-old female patient that demonstrated a pain- ful swelling on the floor of the mouth. The microscopic analysis mandibularwith complaint of â€œulcerations on the tongue.â€� T worsened in the last 6 months when the orthodontic was placed. The patient was vegetarian, and she repo longed menstrual period. Oral examination revealelogic slices stained in hematoxylin and eosin showed a pattern of spindle cells arranged in regular bundles in addition to mitochon- drial areas with little cellularity. Immunohistochemistry was pos- itive for vimentin and Ki67 (4%) and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100, CD34, and caldesmon, leading to a diagno- sis of fibromyxoma. The mandibulectomy was performed associ- ated with application of liquid nitrogen for 3 months without signs of local recurrence.

An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the material was sent for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis; which showed a lesion exhibiting lymphoid, hystiocytic and plasma cell infiltration, occupying the entire mucosal chorion, containing numerous structures with leishmania characteristics. The final diagnosis was mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient underwent clinical and medical treatment with dermatologist, show- ing no signs of recurrence after 1 year.

Caused by protozoa, it occurs more frequently in cutaneous form. Rarely, when it affects the oral mucosa, the disease is destructive or ulcerous-vegetative and granulomatous.

The patient did not have any systemic, metabolic, or endocrine disease. Computed tomographic revealed a lesion with a central area of bone density, ground- glass appearance, and, peripherally, insufflate aspect with internal septations determining expansion. The incisional biopsy was suggestive of a fibro-osseous lesion. Resection was performed followed by immediate reconstruction with autoge- nous bone graft. Microscopic examination revealed irregular shaped trabeculae of immature woven bone in a fibroblastic cell-rich stroma. Peripherally, blood-filled sinusoidal spaces lined by fibrous septa containing scattered multinucleated giant cells were present. The findings were compatible with fibrous dysplasia and aneurysmal bone cyst. The patient is disease-free after 10-month follow-up.intraosseous lesions, and the association of these rare.

In the intraoral examination, a single lesion on the lower lip of about 30 mm characterized by a whitish plaque with a central erythematous and superficially ulcerated area was noted. Cutaneous lesions with dark red staining and keratosis were seen on the hands and feet. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) serologic examination was positive (1:128 dil), concluding the secondary stage syphilis diagnosis. The treat- ment was an intramuscular injection of a penicillin G ampoule benzathine 2,400,000 U. Thirty days after treatment, a total regression of the oral lesion and a partial improvement of the other lesions was observed. With last VDRL result of 1:8, the patient is now healed. FIBROUS DYSPLASIA AND ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST OF THE ZYGOMATIC BONE.

Laboratory tests were requested, which showed sickle cell trait of anemia with presence of microcytic red blood cells as well as iron deficiency and ferritin. The diagno- sis was of major aphthous ulcerations associated with anemia exacerbated by the use of the orthodontic appliance. The patient was advised regarding the feeding and constant use of wax use for mucosal protection and was prescribed topical ste- roid. The patient was referred to the hematologist, gynecolo- gist, and nutritionist because of anemia manifestation. She is being followed up in our service with sporadic episodes of ulcerative lesions. SYPHILIS-MUCOCUTANEOUS MANIFESTA- TIONS.

Tobacco and alcohol con- sumption are classic risk factors for this neoplasm. However, human papillomavirus (HPV) is an additional risk. This report describes the case of OSCC in a 60-year-old black man, a smoker and chronic alcoholic, who complained of â€œpain when swallowing.â€� A left cervical lymph node measuring 3.0 cm that was fixed and painless was observed at the extraoral examina- tion. Intraoral examination revealed a bleeding hard ulcer with raised edges that was painful to palpation, 6.0 cm in diameter, and located in the left soft palate with 6 months of evolution. An incisional biopsy was performed with well-differentiated OSCC stage III diagnosis and negative immunohistochemistry for p16. The patient was submitted to radiotherapy and neoadjuvant che- motherapy. Classical carcinogenesis induced by tobacco and alcohol appears to be associated with this case rather than HPV infection. AGGRESSIVE GRANULAR CELL AMELO- BLASTOMA. ANG ELICA REINHEIMER, FERNANDA MARCELLO SCOTTI, LUIZ HENRIQUE GODOI MAROLA, MURILLO CHIARELLI,LUISA AGUIRRE BUEXM, PRISCILA V FERNANDES, ADRIANA TEREZINHA NOVELLINO ALVES, SIMONE DE QUEIROZMORAIS SILVA A 55-year-old white female patient was referred to our oral medicine department for evaluation of a palate lesion. Past medi- cal history included of a diagnosis of nasal type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma being treated. At the extraoral physical examination there was an increase volume in the upper third of the face involving the whole nose. In the mouth, an exophytic lesion was found, which was hard to palpation and painless with areas of ulceration in the hard palate with approximately 60 days since onset. Incisional biopsy was performed with an inconclusive histopathologic report. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for CD3 and CD56 plus Ki67 positivity in 90% of the cells leading to the diagnosis of nasal T-cell lymphoma/NK type. At the time of diagnosis, chemotherapy was started using cyclo- phosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine (Oncovin), prednisone protocols that promoted a significant decrease in tumor volume. The patient is currently being followed up with no signs or symptoms of recurrence. OROPHARYNGEAL SQUAMOUS CELL CAR- CINOMA AND HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS STATUS: A CASE REPORT.
